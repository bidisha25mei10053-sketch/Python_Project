# Project Statement – Number Guessing Game

1. Problem Statement
Many people enjoy quick, logical games that test their reasoning and guessing ability. This project aims to create a fun and simple console-based game using Python where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player must guess it in the fewest attempts. The project demonstrates the practical use of Python loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

2. Scope of the Project
This project helps beginners understand the core programming concepts in Python such as loops, conditionals, and input handling through an interactive and engaging application.  
It can be expanded in the future by adding features like difficulty levels, score tracking, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The project also serves as a base for learning how to design user-centric applications using Python.


3. Target Users
- Students learning Python programming  
- Beginners who want to practice logic-based coding  
- Anyone looking for a quick, text-based interactive game for entertainment  

4. High-Level Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100  
- Allows user to input guesses with feedback ("Too high" / "Too low")  
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly  
- Option to play multiple rounds  
- Simple, user-friendly console interface
